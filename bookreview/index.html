    <h2> Intro

        <p>The game itself came out April 11, 2005. Since then the game has
            inspired a lot of young people to become interested in the japaneese
            tuner scene. With cars such as the Nissan Skyline, and the Toyota
            Supra, they caught the eyes of many young car enthusiasts. Since
            I first played that game, I was forever interested in cars.</p>
